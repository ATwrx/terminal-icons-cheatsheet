# terminal-icons-cheatsheet
For personal use with i3 and polybar; the icons are not my own creation. See FontAwesome for the full list.

If your only seeing unicode squares, try copy-pasting them in your terminal.
Nothing? You don't have the fonts installed. I'm using the Nerd-Font-Complete pkg from the AUR.
